0x06. Regular expression


The ALX SE project centers around Regular Expressions, or "regexps," utilizing the Oniguruma library. Oniguruma is the default regular expression library in Ruby, offering a powerful toolset for constructing search patterns. It's crucial to note that different regular expression libraries may possess distinct properties, so understanding the nuances of Oniguruma is key to the success of this project. Regular expressions, while potent for string manipulation, demand careful handling due to their intricate nature.
