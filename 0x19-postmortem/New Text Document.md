# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

Hey there! 👋

Ever wonder what happens when the internet takes a coffee break? Well, we had a little hiccup in our web stack recently, and it's storytime! 📖

### The Dramatic Downtime

🕒 **Duration:** May 10, 2024, 15:00 UTC to May 11, 2024, 01:00 UTC  
🔥 **Impact:** Our web app decided to take a siesta, causing chaos for our users. Error rates shot up by 30%, and folks were stuck staring at loading screens. Oops! 😱  
🔍 **Root Cause:** Turns out, our load balancer got a bit too excited and started playing favorites, overloading some servers while neglecting others. Classic case of misconfiguration mischief! 🤦‍♂️

### The Wild Ride

🚨 **Detection:** May 10, 2024, 15:30 UTC - Our monitoring system went berserk, screaming about error rates through the roof!  
🔧 **Actions Taken:** We dove headfirst into server logs and network settings, initially blaming the poor ol' database for feeling the heat. Oopsie! 😬  
🕵️ **Misleading Paths:** Spent hours chasing ghosts in the database, only to find out the real troublemaker was our mischievous load balancer! Sneaky, sneaky... 🕵️‍♀️  
🚨 **Escalation:** Had to call in the big guns from the network infrastructure team to crack this case wide open!  
✨ **Resolution:** May 11, 2024, 00:45 UTC - With a stroke of genius (and a few clicks), we straightened out that load balancer, restoring peace and order to our digital kingdom! Phew! 😅

### Lessons Learned and Battle Plans

📚 **Improvements/Fixes:** We're beefing up our monitoring game and tightening our load balancer configs to prevent any more surprise parties.  
🛠️ **Tasks to Address the Issue:** From updating docs to hosting load balancer boot camps, we're on a mission to make sure this blip remains a one-time affair!

So, there you have it, folks! A rollercoaster ride through the ups and downs of web stack warfare. Until next time, stay vigilant, and keep those load balancers in check! 🚀
