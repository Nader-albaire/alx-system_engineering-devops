Project Title: 0x13. Firewall
Description

This project focuses on implementing firewall configurations to enhance server security. As a DevOpsSysAdminSecurity task, you'll delve into understanding and setting up firewalls, crucial for safeguarding servers from unauthorized access and potential threats. The project spans a 24-hour window, starting from April 15, 2024, at 6:00 AM, and ending by April 16, 2024, at 6:00 AM. The checker for the project was released on April 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM. Additionally, an auto-review will be initiated at the deadline to evaluate the project.
Background Context

Firewalls play a pivotal role in fortifying server security. This project underscores the significance of firewall deployment by illustrating scenarios where servers are vulnerable without firewall protection. By understanding the fundamentals of firewalls and their implementation, participants can effectively mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and potential breaches.
Resources

To aid in understanding the project requirements, participants are encouraged to review materials on "What is a firewall" to grasp the essential concepts surrounding firewall technology.
More Info

As outlined in the web stack debugging guide concept page, telnet serves as a valuable tool for verifying open sockets. By using telnet followed by the server's IP address and port number, users can determine the status of a socket connection. The provided example demonstrates successful and unsuccessful socket connections, illustrating the importance of effective firewall configuration.

Note: Due to network restrictions, testing on web-01 should be conducted from outside the school network, such as from a web-02 server. Additionally, caution must be exercised when configuring firewall rules to prevent unintended consequences, such as being locked out of the server.

Warning: It's imperative to exercise caution when configuring firewall rules, as misconfigurations can lead to severe consequences, such as being unable to reconnect to the server via SSH. Special attention should be given to unblocking port 22/TCP before logging out to ensure continued access to the server.

Limitation: Containers on demand cannot be utilized for this project due to Docker container limitations.

By engaging in this project, participants will deepen their understanding of firewall implementation and enhance their proficiency in server security practices.
